# my-hello-world-app
This is an ordinary Hello World app
During the learning process, I used some useful combinations like:
ctrl + ~ to toggle the Terminal window within VS Code,
up arrow + enter to reenter the last terminal command,
! + tab within a new .html file to insert basic HTML structure to the newly created document.

I also installed Quokka.js and Live Server which are helpful extensions.
